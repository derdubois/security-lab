Summary: Subnetting
Subnetting is the process of splitting a large network into smaller sub-networks. Like slicing a cake — you divide the available IP addresses and assign specific portions to specific groups or departments.

Detailed Explanation
What is Subnetting?
Every network has a limited number of IP addresses. Subnetting lets administrators divide those addresses into organized groups — for example, giving the Accounting department their own mini-network separate from HR or Finance, even though they're all in the same building.

How It Works — Subnet Mask
An IP address has 4 octets (e.g. 192.168.1.100). A subnet mask also has 4 octets (e.g. 255.255.255.0) and it defines which part of the IP is the network and which part identifies the device.

Why Subnetting Matters
Efficiency — Traffic stays within its subnet instead of flooding the whole network. Less congestion.
Security — You can isolate groups from each other. Classic example: a café has two subnets:

One for staff (cash registers, internal systems)
One for customers (public Wi-Fi hotspot)

Even though both connect to the internet, they cannot reach each other — keeping business systems protected.
Control — Admins can manage, monitor, and apply rules to each subnet independently.

Simple Mental Model
Think of subnetting like floors in an office building:

The building = your full network
Each floor = a subnet
Rooms on each floor = individual devices
The elevator = the default gateway that moves traffic between floors
